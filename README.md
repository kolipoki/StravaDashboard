# StravaDashboard

As a side project, I built this dashboard to gain insights into my Strava activity, focusing on my rides. It's also a way to practice my Python skills and explore libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly Express.

## Project Goals

* Analyze ride distance, pace, and other metrics.
* Visualize trends and patterns in my cycling activity.
* Learn how to use Strava API.
* Explore pandas, seaborn, plotly express.
* Use Flake8 for linting.
* Use a virtual environment for running the project.
* Utilize Postman for API testing.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x, libraries in `requirements.txt`.
2. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/kolipoki/StravaDashboard.git`
3. **Setup your Strava app and the API authentication. 
4. **Setup your virtual environment: `python -m venv <folder_name>` activate it `source <folder_name>/Scripts/activate`
5. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. **Get CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REFRESH_TOKEN from <https://www.strava.com/settings/api>
7. **Run the notebook:** Open `strava.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
